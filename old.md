- 👋 Hi, I’m @mnaray
- 👀 I’m interested in basic informatics and network security.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying informatics at BFS BBB in Baden, Switzerland.
- 💞️ I’m currently looking forward to collaborating with someone who is more or less on the same level as me in terms of coding! (check out some recent repos)
- 📫 How to reach me -> Just send an e-mail to **m.naray.inf21@stud.bbbaden.ch**  -  I'll make sure to check it out.
- 📖 To find out more about my experience you're more than welcome to check out my repos and Portfolios here (you'll have to log in) -> https://portfolio.bbbaden.ch/user/m-naray-inf21
